# QuizToLearnEnglish
I created a simple script that helps me in my daily English learning. In an Excel file, I store an English word, a sentence in which it is used, the word in Polish, and count how many times I have correctly entered that word. If I answer incorrectly, the gTTS package will read the text to me in English, so I can hear and read it.
